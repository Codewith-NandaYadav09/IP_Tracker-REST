# IP_Tracker

REST is a type of API that follows a set of rules that make communication between two applications smooth and organized.

Currently, our IP tracker application lacks error handling. For instance, if a user enters a random word in the search input field that is not a valid IP address, the entire application will break.

As conscientious developers, we should always be vigilant about errors and handle them gracefully. Therefore, your challenge is twofold:

1.Implement input validation to ensure that the entered value is always a valid IP address. If the user enters an invalid IP address, display an error message.

2.Handle all unforeseen errors that users may encounter during the application's usage.
